# Geospatial Data Science

In this seminar we covered the basic ideas on how to work with geolocated data in Python. This material supports the class taught at the Telecommunications School of the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. 

It consists of three parts. The first part introduces geopandas and some key concepts for handling geolocated data. The second part discusses ten of the most important operations to perform with geolocated data, as well as the shapely library. The third part introduces ways to visualize geolocated data, in particular, the plotly library.

This material is supported by a video with a theoretical introduction and a detailed explanation of the code. It can be viewed at the following link:
